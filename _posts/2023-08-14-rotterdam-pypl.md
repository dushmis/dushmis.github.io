Rotterdam, Netherlands, had always been on our travel wishlist. The city's modern atmosphere and unique architecture promised an exciting experience. However, our journey took an unexpected turn, revealing how technology can help solve unforeseen challenges.

*Disclaimer: While I work at PayPal, this story is based on personal experiences and is not intended as a promotional piece.*

Arriving via train from Amsterdam to Rotterdam, we were eager to explore the city. Our plan included visiting a museum, and the pleasant weather made walking an appealing choice.

While we enjoyed our walk, the time came to head back to Rotterdam Central. Exhausted, the thought of walking the entire way back was unappealing. Public transportation, though, seemed out of reach, with buses and trams nowhere to be found.

A new challenge emerged: how could we return? The idea of walking seemed daunting, and to our surprise, our credit cards were consistently declined. These cards had worked flawlessly before, leaving us bewildered. Even after reaching out to the bank, it became evident that the issue didn't lie with them.

Even though we were getting pretty annoyed, we weren't about to throw in the towel. We were on the hunt for a solution that didn't involve waving cash around. You see, the Uber we were eyeing only accepted credit cards, and to hop on those nifty Cycles/Scooters, you needed the Uber app and a credit card, sadly ours didn't work. But guess what? A brilliant idea popped into our heads – PayPal to the rescue! Uber did have a PayPal option but i didn't give it a try earlier, After some persistent poking around (and a bunch of times where our credit card just didn't want to play nice, the forex credit card), we were seriously shocked when it actually worked! Ta-da! We snagged an Uber cycle for me and a Donkey bike for my better half, and off we rode, feeling victorious all the way back to Rotterdam Central to catch a train back.

Interestingly, a similar situation arose in Zurich during our trip there. Once again, nothing seemed to work except for PayPal. This reaffirmed our belief in the power of technology to overcome unexpected travel challenges.

This trip showed us how important it is to be open to surprises when we travel. It helped us see how valuable it is to be willing to try new things, especially in places we don't know well. Our time in Rotterdam wasn't just about exploring the city's amazing things; it was also about handling unexpected problems in clever ways.

So, here's to PayPal – the unsung hero of our Rotterdam escapade. It showed that when things don't go as planned, technology can step in and turn our travels into exciting and unforgettable adventures.
